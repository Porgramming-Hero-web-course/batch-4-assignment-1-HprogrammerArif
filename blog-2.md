Title: Handling Async Code in TypeScript: Why async/await is Better Than Callbacks and Promises

When building webapps, we often need to perform tasks that take time, like fetching data from an API or saving information to a database. This is called asynchronous (or async) programming, where some operations don't complete right away. In TypeScript, we can manage these tasks using callbacks, promises, or the more recent and popular async/await syntax. In this blog, we’ll look at why async/await makes handling async tasks easier and more readable than older methods like callbacks and promises.


The Evolution: From Callbacks to Promises to async/await
Callbacks: These were the first way to handle async tasks in JavaScript, but they’re not ideal because they can lead to "callback hell"—where you end up with deeply nested code that’s hard to read and maintain.

Promises: Promises came next, offering a cleaner way to handle async tasks with .then() and .catch() methods. Promises improved readability but could still get complicated with many .then() chains.

async/await: The async/await syntax, introduced in 2017, builds on promises. It allows us to write async code in a way that looks more like regular, sequential code. This makes it easier to read, write, and understand.


Setting Up async/await in TypeScript
In TypeScript, using async/await can be very helpful because TypeScript’s type system checks our code for mistakes. Let’s see how it works with examples.


With async/await, we can turn code into a cleaner version:

function fetchDataAsync(): Promise<string> {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("Data received");
    }, 1000);
  });
}

async function handleData() {
  try {
    const data = await fetchDataAsync();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
  }
}

handleData();


Why async/await is Better than Callbacks or Promises
Clearer Code: async/await makes async code look like regular code, which is easier to follow.
Easier Error Handling: With try/catch, managing errors across async steps is simpler than using .catch().
Better Type Safety: TypeScript can check for type errors earlier, helping avoid runtime bugs.
Control Over Timing: You can handle tasks one by one or run them all at once for faster results.


Conclusion
Using async/await in TypeScript is a modern and effective way to manage async tasks, making code easier to read, understand, and maintain. It outshines older methods like callbacks and promises and works especially well in TypeScript, where type safety adds an extra layer of protection. Try using async/await in your projects to experience the benefits for yourself!
